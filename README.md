Chennai also known as Madras is the capital of an Indian state, Tamil Nadu. It is one of the major metropolitan cities of the country .Recently the city faced an acute water shortage (in June 2019). There are four main reservoirs in the city namely, Red Hills, Cholavaram, Poondi and Chembarambakkam with a combined capacity of 11,057 mcft (million cubic feet). These are the major sources of fresh water for the city. This project is an attempt to put together the dataset that has the information about the various water sources available in the city, visualize the water usage of the various sources using the statistical concept of ANOVA (Analysis Of Variation) and forecast the level of water in near future using the concept of Time Series. This proposal will serve the purpose of managing the available resources efficiently to meet the future water requirements.
